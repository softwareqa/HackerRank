HackerRank
==========

My Solutions to HackerRank(www.hackerrank.com) problems. I put my solutions on GitHub because I find the differences between the solutions people come up with fascinating. If you happen to stumble upon this then I hope you can take something away from it. I know I have found myself searching for other peoples solutions to better myself. <br><br>My reasons for doing these challenges can be broken down as follows:<br>
1)Recreation-They sure beat a crossword or a sudoku puzzle.<br><br>
2)Maintenance of programming mindset- It is essential that a Software QA Engineer always be able to understand the technology and work that is put into the product. This helps to reduce the us vs them scenario that has been historically a problem in software development. <br><br>
3)Comparison of programming languages- I am a firm believer that the learning curve for a new language is insignificant compared to learning the foundations of software development and computer science. However, moving around to different languages for different problems helps me understand the strengths, weaknesses and nuances of a language.<br><br>
4)Practice creating test cases- Many of these challenges are very difficult to write perfect software for. Instead spending time analyzing code for perfection, I find it is more efficient to follow good Test Driven Development methodology to solve the challenge. I enjoy the challenge of figuring out the hidden failing test cases as much as the development itself.
